    <p class="my-brk"><b>Abstract</b>:
    The boundedness of the small Hankel operator induced by an analytic symbol $f$ and the Bergman projection $P_\nu$ associated to $\nu$, acting from the weighted Bergman space $A^p_\omega$ to $A^q_\nu$ is characterized on the full range $0 < p,q < \infty$ when $\omega,\nu$ belong to the class $\mathcal{D}$ of radial weights admitting certain two-sided doubling conditions. Certain results obtained are equivalent to the boundedness of bilinear Hankel forms, which are in turn used to establish the weak factorization of the Bergman spaces. The talk is based on the recent joint work with J.~Rattya, S. Wang and F. Wu.

    <p class="my-brk"><b>Abstract</b>:
      Given a W*-category C, we construct a unitary braided tensor category End_loc(C) of local endofunctors on C, which is a new construction of a braided tensor category associated with an arbitrary W*-category. For the W*-category of finitely generated projective modules over a von Neumann algebra M, this yields a unitary braiding on Popa's χ(M), which extends Connes' χ(M) and Jone's kappa invariant. Given a finite depth inclusion M_0\subset M_1 of non-Gamma II_1 factors, we show that χ(M_\infty) is equivalent to the Drinfeld center of the standard invariant, where M_infty is the inductive limit of the Jones tower of basic construction. <br>

      Determinacy of infinite games and automata on infinite words

    <p class="my-brk"><b>Abstract</b>:
      The Gale-Stewart game, a two-player turn-based infinite game with perfect information, has been intensively studied in descriptive set theory in the past several decades, mainly focusing on the determinacy issue. Automata theory also has a long history and a wide application in theoretical computer science. My research interests lie in the interface of infinite games and automata theory. In the first part of this talk, I will introduce the Gale-Stewart game, some celebrated results on determinacy of infinite games, and then move on to a journey to several variant of finite automata on infinite words. In the second half, I will introduce my joint work with Prof. K. Tanaka. We investigate the determinacy strength of infinite games, in which the winning sets are recognized by nondeterministic pushdown automata with various acceptance, e.g., safety, reachability and co-Buchi conditions. In terms of the foundational program Reverse Mathematics, the determinacy strength of such games is measured by the complexity of a winning strategy required by the determinacy. For instance, we show that the determinacy of games recognized by pushdown automata with a reachability condition is equivalent to weak Konig lemma, stating that every infinite binary tree has an infinite path. <br>

      On conjugacy classes and Grothendieck rings of premodular categories

    <p class="my-brk"><b>Abstract</b>:
      Recently, Shimizu introduced the notion of conjugacy classes for fusion categories, extending the classical notion of conjugacy classes for groups. In this talk we present some new properties of conjugacy classes for pivotal fusion categories. In particular we prove a Burnside type formula for the structure constants concerning the product of two conjugacy class sums of a such fusion category. For a braided weakly integral fusion category C we show that these structure constants multiplied by dim(C) are non-negative integers, extending some results ob- tained recently by Zhou and Zhu in the settings of semisimple quasitriangular Hopf algebras. The talk is based on S. Burciu "Structure constants of premodular categories" Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 53 (2021), no. 3, 777–791 and a work in progress of the author. <br>

    <p class="my-brk"><b>Title</b>: 
      Categorification of integral group rings extended by one dimension
    </p>
    <p class="my-brk"><b>Abstract</b>:
      Fusion categories have established themselves in the past two decades as indispensable objects of study across representation theory, low-dimensional topological quantum field theory, conformal field theory, and quantum computation. But this field of study is at a cross-roads since the production of high-level machinery and abstraction is far out-pacing the set of known examples. At the core of this crisis is the "categorification" problem of determining when there exists a fusion category realizing a given fusion ring, i.e. the combinatorial skeleton of a fusion category. The most elementary fusion rings are the integral character rings of finite groups; it is still a vast open problem to determine which fusion rings with exactly one noninvertible element have corresponding fusion categories. In this talk we will discuss the categorification problem for fusion rings whose basis elements take one of two dimensions. This is the setting where almost all known "exotic" examples of fusion categories live. At least the first half of the talk will be understandable by a general audience. <br>
